About OpenLiteSpeed's PageSpeed Module

This module is not built automatically during OpenLiteSpeed installation. Please follow the following steps to build the PageSpeed Module:

Note: PSOL and OpenLiteSpeed's PageSpeed Module is only available for Linux.

1. Run ./ccc.sh to get the Page Speed Optimization Libraries (PSOL). Please use the version of PSOL included in the ccc.sh file. This version is the latest version we support.

2. Run "make" command to make modpagespeed.so, if compiling does not work, try "gmake" instead of "make".

3. Copy the file to the modules directory in your OpenLiteSpeed installation. (Normally, it should be $LSWS_ROOT/modules/.)

For configuration, please refer to https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/config_filters

OpenLiteSpeed's PageSpeed Module configuration follows the NGINX PageSpeed configuration syntax (in the link above), but without the ";" at the end of each line.

Thanks and enjoy.
