How to build the example module and use it?

There are four steps to do it

1, You need to compile and build it. You can simply use the ccc.sh to compile and build the module.
For example:
  ./ccc.sh hellohandler.c
Then you will get the module file hellehandler.so

2, Copy the module file to $LSWS-HOME/modules/

3, In the admin console, Configuration/Server/Modules/, add the newly created module, in the above example, the name is hellehandler, and enable it.

4, Restart openlitespeed and it should be added.
